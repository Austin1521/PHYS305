    "Bayesian statistics systematically combines our prior knowledge about a situation with new data to refine what we believe is true.\n",
    "In countless real-world scenarios---ranging from medical diagnostics to fundamental physics experiments---information we already have (like the rarity of a disease or theoretical constraints on a physical parameter) can significantly shape how we interpret fresh evidence.\n",
    "By framing unknowns as probability distributions, Bayesian methods provide a coherent framework for updating those distributions whenever new observations appear, yielding a posterior that reflects all evidence, old and new.\n",
    "This unifying perspective makes it possible to quantify uncertainties in a transparent way, avoid common logical pitfalls, and naturally propagate errors to any derived quantities of interest."

    "\n",
    "In the Monty Hall puzzle, Monty's knowledge is crucial.\n",
    "He does not randomly open a door; he always opens a door with a goat.\n",
    "Bayesian updates naturally encode the fact that Monty's behavior provides you information.\n",
    "If Monty had opened a door randomly and happened to reveal a goat, that would yield a very different likelihood function and hence a different posterior.\n",
    "But given Monty's consistent, informed strategy, the posterior probability shifts from $(1/3,1/3,1/3)$ to $(1/3, 0, 2/3)$ for $(A, B, C)$ once door $B$ is shown to have no prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "By showing how the prior (1/3 for each door) is updated by Monty's action (likelihood depends on where the prize is and which door he opens), Bayes' Theorem makes the final distribution (1/3 vs. 2/3) transparent.\n",
    "This is precisely the essence of Bayesian inference: we begin with uniform probabilities, incorporate new evidence, and end up with a posterior distribution that strongly favors the door Monty did not open."
